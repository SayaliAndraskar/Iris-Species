## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## ðŸ’¡ Steps Followed

1. *Imported necessary libraries* (numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib).
2. *Loaded the dataset* (Iris dataset from sklearn or uploaded CSV).
3. *Normalized the features* using StandardScaler.
4. *Split the data* into training and testing sets.
5. *Trained KNN classifier* using different values of K.
6. *Evaluated model performance* using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
7. *Visualized error rate vs K* to choose the best K.
8. *Visualized decision boundaries* (optional, using first two features).

## ðŸ“Š Results

- Achieved high accuracy on test data.
- Confusion matrix and classification report showed strong performance.
- The error rate plot helped in choosing optimal K.
